# Cyber-portfolio

My name is Adrian, and I am currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in cybersecurity at Sans. I first became interested in cybersecurity as a kid when I witnessed hackers in some of my favorite games doing cool stuff like giving people rewards, etc. From then on, I was curious but didn't know where or how to start, so I ultimately gave up on it. Fast forward to high school, and they offered a cybersecurity class that I decided to take. From that point, I have decided to fully commit to and get a degree in cybersecurity. 

As part of my degree program, I had to participate in a CTF competition. As this was my first CTF, the nerves were high, but in the end, I feel much more confident about the next one. The experience forced me to use tools I have never heard of and also explore the world of OSINT. Additionally, I was able to connect and communicate with others to share ideas and assist those who were stuck.

One highlight from the competition was the need to utilize a virtual machine like Kali Linux, and how it helped me increase my skills with commands, navigating, and using the utilities in KALI.
